Oscillart is a You Ship We Ship for Hack Club's Athena Awards.
Oscillart is based on the intersection of math, music, art, and technology. It's a web app that uses sine waves to play the notes to your favorite songs, as well as draw art using those same frequencies. Thus, every time you put in a new melody of notes, you get a unique piece of artwork and music.
Oscillart is an interactive music and visual art web app. Users type a sequence of musical notes, and the app plays them while drawing dynamic sine waves on the screen. The app features:
- *Customizable wave colors* (static or rainbow dynamic mode)
- *Volume and amplitude control* with a slider
- *Multiple layered waves* for a richer visual experience

## How to Use
1. Type a sequence of notes (C, D, E, F, G, A, B) in the input box.
2. Click *Play* to see the waves and hear the music.
3. Use the *volume slider* to adjust sound and wave amplitude.
4. Choose a *wave color*, or enable dynamic rainbow mode for automatically changing colors.
