# Oscillart
Oscillart is a You Ship We Ship for Hack Club's Athena Awards.
Oscillart is based on the intersection of math, music, art, and technology. It's a web app that uses sine waves to play the notes to your favorite songs, as well as draw art using those same frequencies. Thus, every time you put in a new melody of notes, you get a unique piece of artwork and music.
